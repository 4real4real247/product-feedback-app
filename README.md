# Product Feedback App

## üëã Welcome!

Imagine you are a freelance full-stack developer who has just been hired by a new client: a startup that is building a new product. 

Your client wants you to build a Product Feedback application, where customers can view and submit feedback about how to improve the product.

## üéØ Project Requirements

Your users should be able to:

- View all product feedback requests
- Submit a new product feedback request by filling out a form
- Receive form validations when trying to submit a new feedback request
- Filter suggestions by category
- When there no suggestions for the currently selected filter, show the "There is no feedback" screen 
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

Stretch goals (optional):
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests

## üìù Tips for building your project

1. **Pseudo-code before you write any code!** Look through the designs to plan out how you'll tackle the project. Write down your plan somewhere in this README or in your code. 
2. **Work on one feature at a time.** Finish one feature first before you move onto the next thing. Test as you go, routinely checking your site in the browser and making sure there are no errors before moving on. 
3. **Comment your code generously ‚Äî Future You will thank you.** You‚Äôll be building on top of this project over the next 3 months, so help yourself out by writing clear, helpful comments that explain what your code is doing. Trust us, it will save you time and confusion later.
4. **Clean up your code as you go**. Rename confusing variables, remove unused code, and organize your logic. Your code should read like a newspaper: clear, easy to follow, and understandable at a glance.
